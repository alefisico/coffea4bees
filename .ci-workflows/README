All the source files in this directory were moved to `coffea4bees/python/scripts/`.
This is to expose all those scripts to users, and to clean these files.

**This folder only contains the yml files needed for the gitlab CI.**

If you want to try the new `run_container` with the scripts, this is an example:

```bash
cd coffea4bees/python/
run_container source scripts/analysis-test-job.sh
```
